# HBANet
An Accurate Pear Part Detection Model HBANet for Aided Pear Sorting with a Benchmark for Pear Part Detection
This dataset is used for pear Sorting and Pear Part target detection. Images are image files and Annotations are label files in .xml format.

Dataset Description: A pear dataset containing 7351 single pear images, 11234 few pear images, 12592 multi-pear images and 3421 special images (34598 pear images and 154688 precisely labeled objects in total).The types of data sets are as follows:

At present, we have uploaded all the labels and 8758 pictures of the verification set (after the paper is published, I will open source all the data sets and codes, because the pictures in the data set are too large to be stored, so we store them in the form of a network disk.
